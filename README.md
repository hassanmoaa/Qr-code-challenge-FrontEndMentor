    text-align: center;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
}

.card {
        border: 3px solid white;
        border-radius: 20px;
        background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
        padding: 1rem;
